# ShellNet
_Automate searching for vulnerable ShellShock web servers and use them as your Slaves. Create a Botnet._

  
**How this works**:
1. Scan for ShellShock vulnerable servers using a dork such as 'inurl:cgi-bin filetype:cgi'.  
2. Once search completed, move to vuln checker, this will check if servers you scanned are vulnerable and move vulnerable ones to slave list.  
3. Once done, you can exploit your slaves, create a botnet DDoS attack and much more.  
  
  
**To Do**:
* Add custom page search
* Fix Bugs
* Add all the commander modules
  
  
**_Known Bugs_**:
Will sometimes detect non vulnerable servers as vulnerable.
