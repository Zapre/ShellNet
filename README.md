# ShellNet
_Automate searching for vulnerable ShellShock web servers and use them as your Slaves. Create a Botnet._

  
#### How this works:
> Scan for ShellShock vulnerable servers using a dork such as 'inurl:cgi-bin filetype:cgi'.  
> Once search completed, move to vuln checker, this will check if servers you scanned are vulnerable and move vulnerable ones to slave list.  
> Once done, you can exploit your slaves, create a botnet DDoS attack and much more.  
  
  
#### To Do:
* Add custom page search
* Fix Bugs
* Add all the commander modules
  
  
**_Known Bugs_**:
Will sometimes detect non vulnerable servers as vulnerable.
